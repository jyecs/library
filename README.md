# library

I think that the assignment was quite straight forward. I didn't style all that much but I did try to put into practice what I was trying to last time with styles.
I didn't really have the greatest code though as I was sort of hack together. I maybe should have written a method that accepts a whole bunch of arguements using the spread operator. Then return a list of components. That way once im done doing what I need to be doing, I could use another spread operator to append it to one container.
